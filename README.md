# packt-claimer
This is a web utility for claiming your Packt book automatically.

Everday Packt Publishing release a free book at: https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning

This NodeJS server, based apon the code from [Fabio](https://github.com/draconar/)'s repository, [grab_packt](https://github.com/draconar/grab_packt/), allows for a web request on port 80 to be sent to this Node.JS application in order to claim your book.

As this version of code in the repository runs on a web server, it means that (<i>if you're happy passing through your details in plaintext</i>), it can be run in conjunction with services like IFTTT, cron, etc.

^ <i>Obviously, not so secure.</i>

Don't want to host this yourself? Get in touch!

You will recieve daily emails informing you that your book has been claimed with the titles listed.
Alternatively, for £2 a month, we have the capacity to send the title of today's Packt Publishing Free Learning book to your phone via SMS.
